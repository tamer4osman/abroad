# Quality Requirements Document (QRD)
# Libyan Foreign Ministry Management System

**Document Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** April 19, 2025  
**Status:** Updated  
**Prepared by:** Senior Software Architecture Team

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Quality Requirements Document (QRD) defines the specific quality attributes, standards, and metrics that the Libyan Foreign Ministry Management System (LFMMS) must meet. It elaborates on the non-functional requirements outlined in the SRS and TRD, providing clear, measurable criteria to guide development, testing, and acceptance activities, ensuring the final product meets the Ministry's expectations for quality. This version reflects the latest updates in both frontend and backend architecture, modular structure, and deployment practices as of April 2025.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers quality requirements for the LFMMS full-stack application, including frontend (React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS) and backend (Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, MySQL, JWT). It addresses performance, security, reliability, usability, maintainability, scalability, compatibility, internationalization, and operational quality for both client and server.
