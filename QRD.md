## 4. Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

*(Ref: [`TRD.md`](TRD.md #L218))*

-   **Testing Levels:** Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests will be implemented as defined in the TRD.
-   **Test Automation:** Tests will be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Build failures occur on test failures.
-   **Code Coverage:** Unit test code coverage target is >70%.
-   **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing, usability testing, and accessibility testing will be performed manually.
-   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conducted with key stakeholders and end-users at predefined milestones ([`developmentRoadmap.md`](developmentRoadmap.md #L143)) to validate requirements.
-   **Defect Management:** A structured process for reporting, tracking, prioritizing, and resolving defects will be used (e.g., using GitHub Issues, Jira).
-   **Regression Testing:** Automated and manual regression testing performed before each release to ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality.

## 5. Quality Standards

-   **Coding Standards:** Adherence to ESLint/Prettier rules and React/TypeScript best practices ([`TRD.md`](TRD.md #L211)).
-   **Documentation Standards:** Code comments (JSDoc), README updates, architectural decision records (ADRs).
-   **Security Standards:** Compliance with Libyan government data security standards ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L75)), OWASP Top 10 mitigation practices.
-   **Accessibility Standards:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L97)).

## 6. Quality Metrics & Measurement

-   **Code Coverage:** Measured by testing framework reports (e.g., Vitest/Jest coverage).
-   **Defect Density:** Number of defects found per KLOC (thousand lines of code) or per feature.
-   **Defect Resolution Time:** Average time taken to fix reported bugs based on priority.
-   **Test Pass Rate:** Percentage of automated tests passing in CI builds.
-   **Performance Metrics:** Measured using performance monitoring tools (Lighthouse, WebPageTest, browser profiling).
-   **Uptime:** Measured by monitoring services.
-   **User Satisfaction:** Measured via surveys (e.g., System Usability Scale - SUS).
-   **Task Completion Rate:** Measured during usability testing sessions.
