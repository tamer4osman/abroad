## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The LFMMS will be implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) using a client-side rendering (CSR) approach. The frontend will communicate with a backend API (to be specified separately) via RESTful principles over HTTPS. The architecture emphasizes modularity, separating concerns by feature/service type.

### 2.2 Technology Stack

#### 2.2.1 Frontend
-   **Framework/Library:** React 18 ([`README.md`](README.md #L16))
-   **Language:** TypeScript ([`README.md`](README.md #L16))
-   **Build Tool/Bundler:** Vite ([`README.md`](README.md #L16))
-   **Routing:** React Router v6 (Nested routes) ([`README.md`](README.md #L17))

#### 2.2.3 Backend (Assumed/Placeholder)
-   **API:** RESTful API over HTTPS
-   **Authentication:** Token-based (e.g., JWT)
-   **Database:** Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL - *to be specified*)

### 2.3 Component Architecture
-   The application will follow a modular structure based on features/services as outlined in [`README.md`](README.md #L75).
-   **Common Components:** Reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs, modals, layout structures) located in `src/components/common/`.
-   **Feature Components:** Components specific to modules (Civil Registry, Passport, etc.) located in `src/components/[feature-name]/`.
-   **Form Components:** Specialized components for form handling located in `src/components/forms/`.
-   **Hooks:** Custom hooks for reusable logic (API calls, form state, etc.) in `src/hooks/`.
-   **Context:** Global state management providers in `src/context/`.
-   **Utils:** Utility functions (date formatting, validation helpers) in `src/utils/`.
-   **Types:** TypeScript interfaces and types in `src/types/`.

## 3. Data Management

### 3.1 Data Flow
-   Frontend components fetch data from the backend API using custom hooks (e.g., abstracting `fetch` or `axios`).
-   State is managed locally within components or shared via Context API where necessary.
-   Form data is managed using custom hooks, validated on the client-side before submission, and re-validated on the server-side.

### 3.2 Data Validation
-   Client-side validation must be implemented for all user inputs to provide immediate feedback, using libraries like Zod or integrated with form management hooks.
-   Validation rules must align with requirements specified in the [`FRD.md`](FRD.md ) and [`SRS.md`](SRS.md ).
-   Server-side validation is critical and must be implemented by the backend API.

### 3.3 Data Persistence (Client-Side)
-   `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` may be used for persisting non-sensitive user preferences (e.g., theme preference, language).
-   Authentication tokens must be stored securely (e.g., `HttpOnly` cookies handled by the backend, or secure storage mechanisms if required).

### 3.4 Data Migration
-   A strategy for migrating essential data from legacy paper-based systems must be developed (as noted in [`BRD.md`](BRD.md #L167)). This may involve manual data entry interfaces or bulk import tools, depending on data availability and format.

## 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

### 4.1 Design System & Styling
-   Tailwind CSS utility-first approach must be used for all styling.
-   A consistent design language must be maintained across all components.
-   Custom base styles and component styles should be defined in the Tailwind configuration or global CSS files.
-   Dark/Light mode themes must be supported, toggleable by the user ([`README.md`](README.md #L18), [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L98)).

### 4.2 Responsiveness
-   The application must be fully responsive and optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile viewports ([`README.md`](README.md #L87), [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L66)).
-   Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) must be used.

### 4.3 Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n)
-   The primary language is Arabic, requiring full Right-to-Left (RTL) support throughout the UI ([`README.md`](README.md #L22), [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L77)). Tailwind CSS's RTL variants (`rtl:`, `ltr:`) should be utilized.
-   All user-facing strings must be managed through a dedicated i18n library (e.g., `i18next`, `react-intl` - *to be selected*) to facilitate potential future language additions (like English, mentioned as secondary in [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L76)).
-   Date and number formatting must respect localization standards (Gregorian/Hijri support required - [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L78)).

### 4.4 Accessibility (a11y)
-   The application must strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L97)).
-   Semantic HTML must be used.
-   Proper ARIA attributes must be applied where necessary.
-   Keyboard navigation must be fully supported ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L341)).
-   Focus management must be handled correctly, especially in modals and dynamic content.
-   Color contrast ratios must meet accessibility guidelines.

### 4.5 Animations
-   Subtle animations using Framer Motion should enhance UX without hindering performance ([`README.md`](README.md #L19)).
-   Animations should be consistent and meaningful.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*(Referencing [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L313) for details)*

### 5.1 Performance
-   **Page Load Time:** < 2 seconds (First Contentful Paint).
-   **Interaction Response Time:** < 100ms for most UI interactions.
-   **Form Submission:** < 3 seconds (client-side processing).
-   **Optimization:** Utilize Vite's code splitting, lazy loading for routes/components, asset optimization (images, fonts), and efficient state management. Minimize bundle size.
-   **Concurrency:** Frontend should handle API responses efficiently, supporting backend capacity (e.g., 50+ concurrent users per installation).

### 5.2 Scalability
-   Frontend architecture must be modular to allow for easy addition of new features/modules ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L351)).
-   State management patterns should avoid performance bottlenecks as the application grows.
-   API interactions should be efficient to minimize load on the backend.

### 5.3 Security
-   **Authentication:** Implement secure token handling (details depend on backend implementation).
-   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be enforced on the client-side (hiding UI elements) and rigorously enforced on the backend API.
-   **Data Transmission:** All communication with the backend must use HTTPS ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L113)).
-   **Input Sanitization:** While primary sanitization occurs backend, basic client-side checks can prevent trivial injection attempts.
-   **Dependencies:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit`).
-   **Session Management:** Implement session timeout (30 mins inactivity) ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L326)).
-   **Password Policy:** Enforce strong password policies during user management/reset flows ([`FRD.md`](FRD.md #L69)).
-   **2FA:** Support UI flows for Two-Factor Authentication for administrative roles ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L323)).

### 5.4 Reliability
-   **Availability:** Target 99.5% uptime during operational hours ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L330)).
-   **Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling for API failures, network issues, and unexpected client-side errors. Provide user-friendly error messages in Arabic ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L339)).
-   **Data Integrity:** Implement client-side validation to prevent submission of invalid data. Rely on backend for ultimate data integrity enforcement.

### 5.5 Maintainability
-   Adhere to defined coding standards and project structure ([`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L347)).
-   Write clean, well-documented TypeScript code.
-   Use meaningful variable and function names.
-   Ensure components are reusable and have single responsibilities.
-   Keep dependencies updated.

### 5.6 Usability
-   Follow guidelines in [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L336) for intuitive design, consistent terminology, clear messaging, and contextual help.

## 6. Integration Requirements

### 6.1 Backend API Integration
-   All interactions with the backend must occur via a well-defined RESTful API over HTTPS.
-   API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms will be specified in separate API documentation.
-   Implement consistent error handling for API responses (e.g., 4xx, 5xx status codes).

### 6.2 Future Integrations (Phase 4+)
-   The frontend architecture should anticipate future integrations with central ministry systems ([`developmentRoadmap.md`](developmentRoadmap.md #L99), [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L373)).
-   API interaction layers should be abstracted to facilitate potential changes or additions to backend services.

## 7. Development Standards & Practices

### 7.1 Version Control
-   **System:** Git
-   **Platform:** GitHub (or specified alternative)
-   **Branching Strategy:** Gitflow (or a similar structured model like GitHub Flow) must be used. Main branches (`main`/`master`, `develop`) should be protected. Features developed in separate branches.
-   **Commit Messages:** Follow Conventional Commits standard.

### 7.2 Coding Standards
-   Adhere to rules defined in the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations ([`README.md`](README.md #L40)).
-   Follow standard React/TypeScript best practices (e.g., hooks rules, immutability, proper typing).
-   Code must be well-commented, especially for complex logic or non-obvious implementations.

### 7.3 Testing Strategy
-   **Unit Tests:** Use a testing framework like Vitest or Jest with React Testing Library to test individual components, hooks, and utility functions. Aim for >70% code coverage.
-   **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between components and modules, including routing and context usage.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use frameworks like Cypress or Playwright to test critical user flows across the application.
-   Tests should be run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### 7.4 Build & Deployment
-   **Build Process:** Use Vite (`npm run build`) to create optimized production builds.
-   **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` files (`.env.development`, `.env.production`) for environment-specific configuration (e.g., API base URLs). Ensure no sensitive information is committed.
-   **CI/CD:** Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automate testing, building, and deployment to staging/production environments.
-   **Deployment Target:** Web server capable of serving static files and handling SPA routing (e.g., Nginx, Apache, cloud hosting services).

## 8. Operational Requirements

### 8.1 Monitoring
-   Implement basic frontend performance monitoring (e.g., using browser APIs like PerformanceObserver, potentially integrating with tools like Sentry, Datadog).
-   Track key user interactions and errors.

### 8.2 Logging
-   Client-side errors should be logged and potentially sent to a centralized logging service (e.g., Sentry) for analysis.
-   Audit logging of user actions is primarily a backend responsibility but requires frontend cooperation to trigger relevant API calls ([`FRD.md`](FRD.md #L46), [`SRS.md`](SRS.md #L325)).

### 8.3 Backup & Recovery
-   Frontend application code is managed via version control (Git).
-   User data backup and recovery are backend responsibilities ([`FRD.md`](FRD.md #L401)).
