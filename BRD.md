# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
# Libyan Foreign Ministry Management System

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** April 14, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Prepared by:** Senior Software Architecture Team

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the high-level business needs and objectives for the development and implementation of the Libyan Foreign Ministry Management System (LFMMS). It defines the business rationale for the project, the expected benefits, and the key success factors from a business perspective. This document serves as a foundational agreement between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the project team regarding the project's goals and scope.

### 1.2 Project Background
The Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs currently relies heavily on manual, paper-based processes for delivering consular services through its diplomatic missions worldwide. These processes are often inconsistent, inefficient, prone to errors, and lack adequate security and auditability. This results in long processing times for citizens, high operational costs for the Ministry, and limited ability to gather accurate data for strategic decision-making. The LFMMS project aims to address these challenges by introducing a modern, integrated digital platform.

### 1.3 Business Opportunity
The implementation of the LFMMS presents a significant opportunity for the Ministry to:
- **Modernize Operations:** Align consular services with international best practices and digital government standards.
- **Enhance Citizen Services:** Improve the experience for Libyan citizens abroad by providing faster, more transparent, and consistent services.
- **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce manual effort, minimize paperwork, and streamline workflows across all diplomatic missions.
- **Improve Data Management:** Establish a centralized, secure repository for citizen and consular data, enabling better reporting and analytics.
- **Strengthen Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive citizen information and ensure data integrity.

### 1.4 Document Scope
This BRD covers the high-level business requirements for the LFMMS, encompassing all core consular service areas: Civil Registry, Passport Services, Visa Processing, Document Attestation, and Legal Proxy Management. It focuses on the business needs and outcomes, not the specific technical implementation details (which are covered in the FRD, SRS, and PRD).

## 2. Business Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Business Goals
1.  **Improve Consular Service Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the time and resources required to process citizen requests across all service types.
2.  **Enhance Citizen Satisfaction:** Provide a more positive, predictable, and accessible service experience for Libyan citizens abroad.
3.  **Standardize Operations Globally:** Ensure consistent procedures, documentation, and service levels across all Libyan diplomatic missions.
4.  **Strengthen Data Security and Integrity:** Protect sensitive citizen data and ensure the accuracy and reliability of consular records.
5.  **Enable Data-Driven Decision Making:** Provide Ministry leadership with accurate, timely data and analytics on consular operations.

### 2.2 Measurable Business Objectives
- Reduce average application processing time by 40% within 12 months of full deployment.
- Decrease operational costs related to paper, printing, and manual handling by 30% within 18 months.
- Achieve an 80% citizen satisfaction rating for consular services within 24 months.
- Ensure 100% adoption and utilization of the LFMMS across all diplomatic missions within 24 months.
- Reduce data entry errors by 90% compared to the previous manual system.
- Generate comprehensive monthly operational reports automatically, reducing manual reporting effort by 95%.
